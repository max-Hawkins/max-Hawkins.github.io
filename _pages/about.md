I'm a Computational Science and Engineering PhD student at Georgia Tech advised by Richard Vuduc and Spencer Bryngelson. My research involves the intersection of high-performance computing, computational fluid dynamics, and SmartNICs/Data Processing Units. I want to help scientists effectively and efficiently utilize their hardware for good. If you have a comment, question, or otherwise want to contact me, please email mhawkins60@gatech.edu

Personally, I enjoy working with my hands and *touching grass* when I'm not studying or coding. The implementations of that idea are seen in my interests in woodworking, gardening, and more recently, art. I also love to travel and try to keep myself open to unexpected, novel experiences.
