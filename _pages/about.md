I'm a computer engineering undergraduate student at the University of Alabama interested in helping scientists easily and effectively utilize their computing hardware for good.

Most of my research and work experience is in the realm of high-performance computing applied to radio astronomy digital signal processing, but I'm also interested in compiler development, the Julia programming language (see my work on [a GPU backend for Apple hardware](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/Metal.jl)), and working to enable a more sustainable future (i.e. I'm hoping to get involved in nuclear fusion simulation acceleration).

My old blog is currently hosted [here](http://theclimategap.com), but I'm working to port those posts to this site to reduce site maintenance and costs. I also have an archived science education website, [NaturallyFundamental.com](http://naturallyfundamental.com), but porting that here will take a bit longer.

Personally, I enjoy working with my hands and *touching grass* when I'm not studying or coding. The implementations of that idea are seen in my interests in woodworking, gardening, and more recently, art. I also love to travel and try to keep myself open to unexpected, novel experiences.
